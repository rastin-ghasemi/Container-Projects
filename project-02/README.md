project focuses on multiple stages.
 
This Dockerfile is a multi-stage build for a Node.js application that uses React (or any front-end framework) and serves the built files using Nginx. Letâ€™s break it down step by step:

## What is multi-stage build?

A multi-stage build is a feature in Docker that allows you to use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile. Each FROM statement defines a new build stage, and you can selectively copy files from one stage to another. This is particularly useful for:

-- Reducing the size of the final Docker image.

-- Improving security by excluding unnecessary tools and dependencies.

-- Optimizing the build process by leveraging Docker's layer caching.

## How Multi-Stage Builds Work
-- Define Multiple Stages:

Each stage starts with a FROM statement and can use a different base image.

Stages are independent, and files from one stage are not automatically available in another.

Copy Files Between Stages:

Use the COPY --from=<stage> command to copy files from one stage to another.

Final Image:

Only the last stage in the Dockerfile is used to create the final image. Earlier stages are discarded unless explicitly copied.



## Example: Multi-Stage Build for a Node.js Application Dockerfile
 # Stage 1: Build the application and call it installer
	FROM node:18-alpine AS installer
 # 2: Sets the working directory inside the container to /app. All subsequent commands will run from this directory.
	WORKDIR /app
 # 3: Copy Dependency Files:
   This ensures that only dependency files are copied first, allowing Docker to cache this layer for faster builds.
	COPY package*.json ./
 # 4: Installs all Node.js dependencies listed in package.json.
	RUN npm install 
 # 5: Copy Application Code:
   Copies the rest of the application code (e.g., src, public, etc.) into the /app directory.
	COPY . .
 # 6: Build the Application:
	RUN npm run build
 # Stage 2: Serve the Application
   Uses the official Nginx image to serve the static files built in Stage 1 and named it deployer.
	FROM nginx:latest AS deployer
 # 2: Copies the build folder (generated in Stage 1) from the installer stage into the Nginx HTML directory (/usr/share/nginx/html).
   Nginx serves the files from this directory by default.	
	COPY --from=installer /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
