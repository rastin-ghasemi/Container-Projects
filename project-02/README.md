project focuses on multiple stages.
 
This Dockerfile is a multi-stage build for a Node.js application that uses React (or any front-end framework) and serves the built files using Nginx. Letâ€™s break it down step by step:

## First step What is multi-stage build?

A multi-stage build is a feature in Docker that allows you to use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile. Each FROM statement defines a new build stage, and you can selectively copy files from one stage to another. This is particularly useful for:

-- Reducing the size of the final Docker image.

-- Improving security by excluding unnecessary tools and dependencies.

-- Optimizing the build process by leveraging Docker's layer caching.

## How Multi-Stage Builds Work
-- Define Multiple Stages:

Each stage starts with a FROM statement and can use a different base image.

Stages are independent, and files from one stage are not automatically available in another.

Copy Files Between Stages:

Use the COPY --from=<stage> command to copy files from one stage to another.

Final Image:

Only the last stage in the Dockerfile is used to create the final image. Earlier stages are discarded unless explicitly copied.
